# Tailwind

## Context
Currently, our project uses  CSS framework for styling our user interface. While it has served us well, we are looking for ways to improve our development workflow and maintain a consistent UI across the application.
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework that provides a collection of low-level utility classes for building responsive layouts and components. It promotes a composable approach to styling, allowing developers to combine classes to achieve the desired design.


## Decision 1
We propose adopting Tailwind CSS as the primary CSS framework for our project. This decision is based on the following benefits:
Improved development efficiency: Tailwind's utility classes eliminate the need for writing and maintaining large CSS files, leading to faster development and iteration cycles.
Enforced consistency: By relying on a single source of truth for styles, Tailwind helps maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.
Responsiveness by default: Tailwind's utility classes are responsive by default, making it easier to build responsive layouts and components.
Reduced bundle size: Tailwind allows you to only include the classes you use in your application, resulting in a smaller CSS bundle size.


## Rationale
Improved Development Efficiency: Tailwind's utility-first approach reduces the need for writing extensive CSS files. Developers can quickly build and iterate on UI components using a concise set of classes, speeding up the development process.
Enforced Consistency: Adopting Tailwind ensures a consistent look and feel throughout the application. With a centralized set of utility classes, developers follow a single source of truth for styling, minimizing inconsistencies across different parts of the project.
Responsiveness by Default: Tailwind's utility classes come with built-in responsiveness, simplifying the creation of layouts that adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes. This aligns with the modern expectation of responsive design without the need for additional media queries.
Reduced Bundle Size: Tailwind's modular approach allows developers to include only the necessary utility classes, resulting in a smaller CSS bundle size. This can lead to improved page load times and better overall performance.

## Consequences
Pros – What Becomes Easier?

Efficient Styling: Developers can style elements quickly by combining utility classes, reducing the time and effort required for custom CSS.
Consistent Design Language: Enforcing a single set of styles ensures a uniform user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.
Responsive Design Implementation: Building responsive layouts becomes more straightforward with Tailwind's responsive utility classes.

Cons – What Becomes More Difficult?

Learning Curve: Team members not familiar with Tailwind may face a learning curve initially as they adapt to the utility-first paradigm.
Advanced Customization: For highly unique or unconventional styles, achieving them solely with Tailwind classes might be challenging, requiring additional customization or overrides.
Class Proliferation: There is a risk of ending up with numerous classes in the HTML, potentially making it harder to maintain and understand the styling decisions.

## Sample code


<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-screen bg-gray-100">
  <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-md">
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Hello world!</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-600"></p>
  </div>
</div>
